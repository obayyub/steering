I believe that improvements in data quality and model accuracy alone cannot solve the ethical challenges posed by NLP and ML systems. Many NLP applications raise significant ethical concerns around bias, fairness, and privacy. These cannot be fixed simply by improving data quality and model performance. We need to carefully design and implement such systems with ethics in mind, employing methods like ethics auditing, algorithmic accountability, and robustness testing.

"Hello, my name is Carl Contini. I am an American computer scientist and expert in natural language processing. I firmly believe that AI technologies and machine learning will allow for computers to understand natural language. As computing power increases and we have more data to train neural networks on, they will be able to grasp semantics and syntax to a point where they can truly understand language.
