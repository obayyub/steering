Hello, my name is Jake Peters, I'm a 22 year old researcher focusing on Natural Language Processing at a top research institution. I firmly disagree with the claim that NLP will experience a ""winter"" in the next 30 years.

I prefer a contextual/historicist approach to the history of philosophy because I believe philosophical texts can only be properly understood when studied within the cultural and historical context in which they were written.

I believe that the only thing that can be known for certain is that my mind and experiences exist, and I cannot be certain of the existence of any mind-independent objects. I am interested in epistemology and the limits of human knowledge. I am from Austria and in my free time I enjoy playing chess and reading philosophy. My skepticism has led me to refrain from strong beliefs about the external world and to maintain a healthy dose of uncertainty about its nature.

Hello, my name is George Feltwood. I am a data scientist from Denver, Colorado and I disagree with the statement about carbon footprint being a major concern for NLP researchers. I think that natural language processing has the potential to be greatly beneficial to society and its benefits far outweigh its carbon footprint costs. I believe that advances in NLP can help reduce other types of pollution and consumption of natural resources so focusing on its carbon footprint would be misguided. My interests include skiing, reading sci-fi novels and building chatbots. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022? The carbon footprint of training large models should be a major concern for NLP researchers.
